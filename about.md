Hello! I am Julianny and I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Campinas 🙋 I was born in a city in the midwest of São Paulo, Brazil, called Bauru.

I've always been a person who liked a lot of math, but I wanted to be involved with more technologies, like computers. That was the opportunity to try a vacancy in a technical college in Bauru, CTI (Industrial Technical College, at Unesp Bauru, a well-known public university), to learn IT. And that's when I started to like computers :) I remember until today how much I was amazed with a simple program of calculating average in Pascal and it was there that everything changed!

After high school, I started to study Computer Science at Unicamp, Campinas, and so far it's been the hardest I've ever done ... until I get the Apple Developer Academy, a project that has changed a lot in me and has been changing, in the way of seeing things and the real problems faced by everyone today. Certainly one of the best decisions I made was to try and be part of it! 💻 ✅

I know I still have a lot to see and do, the idea is to post some interesting things around here, so I'll continue!

Thanks for reading my story!
