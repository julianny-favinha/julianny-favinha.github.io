_An app to improve UNICAMP community's experience in the university dining halls_

# Bandex


Bandex is an application for iOS that displays the weekly menu of the university restaurants of Unicamp, Campinas.<br>

I, as a student at the university, eat at least once a day in the "bandejÃ£o" or "bandeco", nicknames affectionately given by the students. There's always that moment of the day when that hunger strikes and you're curious to know the menu of the day. Between the friends a conversation takes place every day about "Who's going to eat at the â€˜bandejÃ£oâ€™ today??" or â€œDo you know what to have in the â€˜bandecoâ€™ today?â€œ. Always someone has the answer, and it's always cool to go with the crew.

The idea of Bandex arose from the desire to facilitate the daily viewing menu. The main concern was that the interaction should be fast, the information should be displayed without confusion.

As we wanted to make life easier for people who use Unicamp's restaurants, besides displaying the menu, Bandex also has a system of notifications at lunch and dinner, informing you of the main menu of that meal. ðŸ˜±

Another cool thing the app has is a widget, another easy and quick way to access the menu.<br>
