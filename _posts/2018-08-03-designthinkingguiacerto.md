_The process to build Guia Certo_

# Design thinking to build Guia Certo


How to improve the experience of travelers who want to find tours that are ideal, always maintaining quality and looking to avoid unforeseen?

To explore the problem and answer a lot of questions, we used the Design Thinking.

We talked to travelers and tour guides and in this process we discovered several difficulties that they face. We've come up with a number of ideas on how to solve the problems we've encountered and create prototype solutions. We tested the created prototypes and implement their functionalities.

Talking with travelers and tourists we find that they seek meaningful experiences in their travels, and find it difficult to find contacts of guides and tours in advance.

Talking with tour guides we find that they also have a lot of difficulty in publish their work.

The best way to avoid unforeseen travel is to get the help of a professional guide. We found that the body that regulates the profession is Cadastur, so in order to solve these problems both of guides and travelers, we decided to create a solution that connects the tour guides registered by Cadastur and travelers.

In the process to develop the application, we find the site <a href="http://dados.gov.br">dados.gov.br</a>, which has the data of all the tourist guides registered in Brazil. That way, we have created a consistent database where the tour guide only increases your profile with other relevant information and adds your tours.
